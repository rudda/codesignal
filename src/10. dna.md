# DNA Health Problem

## Problem Description

DNA is a nucleic acid present in the bodies of living things. Each piece of DNA contains a number of genes, some of which are beneficial and increase the DNA's total health. Each gene has a health value, and the total health of a DNA is the sum of the health values of all the beneficial genes that occur as a substring in the DNA. We represent genes and DNA as non-empty strings of lowercase English alphabetic letters, and the same gene may appear multiple times as a substring of a DNA.

Given the following:

- An array of beneficial gene strings, `genes`. Note that these gene sequences are not guaranteed to be distinct.
- An array of gene health values, `health`, where each `health[i]` is the health value for gene `genes[i]`.
- A set of `s` DNA strands where the definition of each strand has three components: `start`, `end`, and `d`, where string `d` is a DNA for which genes `genes[start]` to `genes[end]` are healthy.

Find and print the respective total healths of the unhealthiest (minimum total health) and healthiest (maximum total health) strands of DNA as two space-separated values on a single line.

## Input Format

1. The first line contains an integer, `n`, denoting the total number of genes.
2. The second line contains `n` space-separated strings describing the respective values of `genes` (i.e., the elements of `genes`).
3. The third line contains `n` space-separated integers describing the respective values of `health` (i.e., the elements of `health`).
4. The fourth line contains an integer, `s`, denoting the number of strands of DNA to process.
5. Each of the `s` subsequent lines describes a DNA strand in the form `start end d`, denoting that the healthy genes for DNA strand `d` are `genes[start]` to `genes[end]` and their respective correlated health values are `health[start]` to `health[end]`.

## Output Format

Print two space-separated integers describing the respective total health of the unhealthiest and the healthiest strands of DNA.

## Example

### Input

```
6
a b c aa d b
1 2 3 4 5 6
3
1 5 caaab
0 4 xyz
2 4 bcdybc
```

### Output

```
0 15
```

### Explanation

- **First DNA Strand:**
  ```
  1 5 caaab
  ```
  - Healthy genes index range: `1 to 5` (inclusive)
  - DNA string: `caaab`
  - Genes in range: `b c aa d b`
  - Health values in range: `2 3 4 5 6`
  - Total health calculation:
    - First `b` (index 1) appears 1 time with health 2: `2`
    - `c` appears 1 time with health 3: `3`
    - `aa` appears 1 time with health 4: `4`
    - `d` does not appear: `0`
    - Second `b` (index 5) appears 1 time with health 6: `6`
    - Total health for this strand: `2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 15`
  
- **Second DNA Strand:**
  ```
  0 4 xyz
  ```
  - Healthy genes index range: `0 to 4` (inclusive)
  - DNA string: `xyz`
  - Genes in range: `a b c aa d`
  - Health values in range: `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Total health calculation:
    - `a` does not appear: `0`
    - `b` does not appear: `0`
    - `c` does not appear: `0`
    - `aa` does not appear: `0`
    - `d` does not appear: `0`
    - Total health for this strand: `0`
  
- **Third DNA Strand:**
  ```
  2 4 bcdybc
  ```
  - Healthy genes index range: `2 to 4` (inclusive)
  - DNA string: `bcdybc`
  - Genes in range: `c aa d`
  - Health values in range: `3 4 5`
  - Total health calculation:
    - `c` appears 2 times with health 3: `3 * 2 = 6`
    - `aa` does not appear: `0`
    - `d` appears 1 time with health 5: `5`
    - Total health for this strand: `6 + 5 = 11`

### Output

```
0 15
```
