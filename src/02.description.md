Given the string, check if it is a palindrome.

### Palindrome
A string that doesn't changed when reversed (it reads the same backward and forward).

### Examples:

"eye" is a palindrome
"noon" is a palindrome
"decaf faced" is a palindrome
"taco cat" is not a palindrome (backwards it spells "tac ocat")
"racecars" is not a palindrome (backwards it spells "sracecar")

### Example

For inputString = "aabaa", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true;
For inputString = "abac", the output should be
solution(inputString) = false;
For inputString = "a", the output should be
solution(inputString) = true.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ inputString.length ≤ 105.

    [output] boolean

true if inputString is a palindrome, false otherwise.
