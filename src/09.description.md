There is a text-messaging service. It provides you with an API to send SMSs to a user,
but they can be at most 160 characters long.

Your team wants to build a campaign which requires sending long pieces of texts over this service.

You have to build a function which splits the text in chunks so that it can be sent in multiple messages.

Each chunk has to be:
 - up to 160 characters long
 - no word should be split in the middle
 - each chunk has to have its order suffixed in the form of ' (k/n)', e.g. "this is the first chunk (1/2)",
 "this is the second chunk (2/2)"
 - if the text provided to the function is less than 160 characters, no ordering should be suffixed
